Train Management System - Requirements Specification

Background:
This document describes the requirements for a Train Management System (TMS) that will track train locations, manage schedules, and provide real-time updates to operators. The system is being developed to modernize legacy infrastructure.

Functional Requirements:

The system shall track real-time location of all active trains with GPS accuracy of ±10 meters and shall update the central database every 30 seconds.

The TMS must authenticate operators via multi-factor authentication before granting access.

The system should display train schedules in a user-friendly format on the operator dashboard.

Train status updates shall be sent to the monitoring service via REST API whenever a train changes state (e.g., departing, arriving, delayed).

The system shall generate daily reports of train operations and must archive them for at least 7 years for compliance purposes.

Operators shall be able to manually override automated routing decisions in emergency situations, but all overrides must be logged with justification.

Performance and Constraints:

The dashboard must load quickly to ensure operators can respond to incidents.

The system shall support up to 500 simultaneous operator connections.

REQ-PERF-01: Database queries shall complete within 200ms for 95% of requests.

The system may use third-party mapping services for route visualization.

All train location data must be encrypted both in transit and at rest using AES-256.

The TMS shall operate 24/7 with 99.9% uptime.

System responses should feel responsive to maintain operator confidence.
