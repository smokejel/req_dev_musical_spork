SATELLITE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM SPECIFICATION REV 2.3

This system provides satellite communication capabilities for remote operations. It replaces the old system which had many problems and was not reliable. The new system will be much better.

REQUIREMENTS

Communication with satellites shall happen using X-band frequencies and the system must handle multiple simultaneous connections which is important for operations and the ground station shall process uplink commands within 50ms to ensure timely delivery and satellite responses must be received and decoded properly.

Security is very important. All communications are encrypted. The system uses modern cryptographic standards.

The ground station must monitor satellite health telemetry continuously tracking temperature voltage and orientation data and must generate alerts when anomalies are detected so operators can respond quickly to prevent mission failures.

Operators need a dashboard. It should show satellite positions, communication status, and command history. The interface must be intuitive and easy to use even for new operators.

Table 1: Performance Requirements
- Uplink data rate: 10 Mbps minimum
- Downlink data rate: 50 Mbps minimum
- Command latency: < 50ms
- Signal acquisition: < 5 seconds
- Concurrent satellites: 10 maximum

The system shall maintain connection logs for audit purposes.

When a satellite goes out of range, the system should queue commands for later transmission and prioritize critical commands appropriately.

ERROR HANDLING: The system must detect transmission errors and automatically retry failed commands up to 3 times before alerting operators. Error rates shall not exceed 0.1% under normal conditions.

Database: All telemetry data is stored in the central database. Historical data going back 5 years is required for trend analysis. The database shall be backed up daily and backup retention is 10 years minimum for regulatory compliance.

The system may integrate with third-party orbit prediction services to optimize communication windows. Integration is optional.

INTERFACES: The system will communicate with the Mission Control System via TCP/IP using a custom protocol. The protocol specification is defined in document MCS-ICD-001. The system shall also provide a REST API for external monitoring tools and must support webhook notifications for critical events.

Power requirements: The ground station equipment shall operate on standard 110V/220V power and shall include UPS backup providing at least 4 hours of operation during power outages.

Weather: The system must continue operating in extreme weather conditions including temperatures from -20C to +50C humidity up to 95% and wind speeds up to 100 km/h.

Maintenance: The system shall support remote diagnostics and firmware updates without requiring physical access to ground station equipment. Updates can be scheduled during maintenance windows.

For compliance with FCC regulations, the system shall implement frequency hopping and power control features. Specific requirements are detailed in FCC filing 2024-SAT-892.

The operator console must support multiple languages but English is required as primary.

TRAINING: Operators need training before using the system. Training materials will be provided separately.

Real-time visualization of satellite orbits shall be displayed on a 3D globe interface with ability to zoom and rotate.

Archive: Mission data shall be archived to offline storage after 90 days of online retention.
