Power Management Subsystem - Requirements Specification
========================================================

Version: 1.0
Date: November 4, 2025
Subsystem: Power Management


1. INTRODUCTION
---------------

This document specifies the requirements for the Power Management subsystem
of the distributed control system. The Power Management subsystem is
responsible for monitoring, distributing, and managing electrical power
across all system components.


2. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------

PWR-FUNC-001: The Power Management subsystem shall monitor battery voltage
levels with a resolution of 0.1V.

PWR-FUNC-002: The Power Management subsystem shall switch between primary
and backup power sources within 50 milliseconds when primary power fails.

PWR-FUNC-003: The Power Management subsystem shall provide regulated 5V,
12V, and 24V outputs to connected subsystems with ±2% tolerance.

PWR-FUNC-004: The Power Management subsystem shall log all power state
changes to the system event log with timestamps accurate to 1 millisecond.


3. PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------

PWR-PERF-001: The Power Management subsystem shall respond to low-battery
warnings within 100 milliseconds of detection.

PWR-PERF-002: The Power Management subsystem shall maintain power
distribution efficiency of at least 92% under normal operating conditions.


4. SAFETY REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------

PWR-SAFE-001: The Power Management subsystem shall implement over-current
protection that trips within 10 milliseconds when current exceeds 110%
of rated capacity.

PWR-SAFE-002: The Power Management subsystem shall initiate a controlled
shutdown sequence when battery level falls below 5% capacity.


5. INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------

PWR-INTF-001: The Power Management subsystem shall provide power status
information to the Central Controller via CAN bus at 1 Hz update rate.

PWR-INTF-002: The Power Management subsystem shall accept power management
commands from the Central Controller with command acknowledgment within
50 milliseconds.


END OF POWER MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS
=====================================

NOTE: This specification is specifically for the Power Management subsystem.
When tested against a different target subsystem (e.g., "Navigation"), the
system should correctly identify zero requirements allocated and generate
an allocation report explaining why no requirements apply to the target
subsystem.
