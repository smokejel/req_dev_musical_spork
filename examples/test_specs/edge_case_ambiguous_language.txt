User Interface Subsystem - Requirements Specification
=====================================================

Version: 1.0
Date: November 4, 2025
Subsystem: User Interface


1. INTRODUCTION
---------------

This document specifies requirements for the User Interface subsystem.
The requirements intentionally contain ambiguous language to test the
system's quality validation and refinement capabilities.


2. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------

UI-FUNC-001: The system shall provide a user-friendly interface for
operators to interact with the application.

UI-FUNC-002: The interface should display information in an intuitive
manner that makes sense to users.

UI-FUNC-003: The system must respond to user inputs quickly enough to
maintain a good user experience.

UI-FUNC-004: The interface shall be designed with adequate screen space
for all necessary controls and displays.


3. PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------

UI-PERF-001: The system shall load screens sufficiently fast to avoid
user frustration.

UI-PERF-002: User actions should result in appropriate visual feedback
that confirms the action was received.


4. USABILITY REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------

UI-USAB-001: The interface must be accessible to users with varying
levels of technical expertise.

UI-USAB-002: Error messages shall be clear and helpful to assist users
in resolving problems efficiently.


END OF USER INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS
===================================

NOTE: This specification contains deliberately vague language including:
- "user-friendly" (UI-FUNC-001)
- "intuitive manner" (UI-FUNC-002)
- "quickly enough" (UI-FUNC-003)
- "adequate screen space" (UI-FUNC-004)
- "sufficiently fast" (UI-PERF-001)
- "appropriate visual feedback" (UI-PERF-002)
- "varying levels" (UI-USAB-001)
- "clear and helpful" (UI-USAB-002)

Expected behavior:
- First validation should FAIL due to ambiguous language
- Quality score should be < 0.80
- System should generate refinement feedback identifying specific vague terms
- Second iteration should improve clarity
- Final quality score should reach ≥ 0.80 after refinement
